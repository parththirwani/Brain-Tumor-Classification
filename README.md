# Brain-Tumor-Classification
 
Worked on a multi class classification for brain tumor using the Brain tumor dataset-- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset. Introduced a new form of deep learning architecture in which the VGG 16 model has been nested inside anothe VGG 16 model for the intricate classification of brain tumors.
